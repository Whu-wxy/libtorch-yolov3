## libtorch-yolov3
A Libtorch implementation of the YOLO v3 object detection algorithm, written with pure C++. It's fast, easy to be integrated to your production, and CPU and GPU are both supported. Enjoy ~

This project is inspired by the [pytorch version](https://github.com/ayooshkathuria/pytorch-yolo-v3), I rewritten it with C++.

# Requirements
1. LibTorch v1.0.0
2. Qt5
3. OpenCV
4. VLC-Qt




## Running the detector

Get the weights file for v3:

```
cd models
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights 
```
